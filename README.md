# .gov.jm domains

You can view or download a list of `.gov.jm` domains.

The listing is compiled from the "Government Links" list provided by the
Jamaican government at <http://jis.gov.jm/government/links/>. Domains from that
list not ending in `.gov.jm` are excluded from this listing.

## Further Plans

To see if the Government of Jamaica would be willing to provide a canonical
listing and provide it on the [Jamaica Open Data Portal](http://data.gov.jm)
website as a dataset.

To develop a utility to generate the listing.
